EoD servers have **play channels** where they combine elements. You can add more channels to have a less laggy experience. 
Make a new channel and use **/set playchannel** to mark a channel as a play channel.

In addition to play channels, EoDE requires a **voting channel** and a **news channel**.

In a voting channel, polls are created to vote on whether a suggestion should be accepted. 
Use **/set votes** to set the number of votes required for a poll to be deleted or accepted.
use **/set votingchannel** to set the channel where polls should be sent.
Use **/set polls** to set the maximum number of polls a user can create.

In a news channel, a log of polls accepted is sent. Use **/set newschannel** to set the news channel.

Use **/set modrole** to set a role that can use administrative commands.

For a simple EoD server, check out the **Official EoD Server Template**:
