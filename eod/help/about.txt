EoD Everywhere is a community-based alchemy game inspired by Elemental 3, Little Alchemy, and Doodle God created in a Discord bot. Players start with 4 elements: Air, Earth, Fire, and Water. The ability to combine these and make new ones is what makes the game special. It is completely based on the community!

Head to the **Basics** section to learn the basics of using the bot!
