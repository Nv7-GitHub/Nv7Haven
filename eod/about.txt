EoD Everywhere is an alchemy game built entirely with a Discord bot. Check out the **Using the Bot** section to learn about the commands! Each server has a separate element list and can be customized by server admins to change channel types, vote counts, and even directly modify a user's inventory! Check out the **Useful Admin Commands** section for more info.

**Using the Bot**
You can combine elements in any play channel by seperating element names by a **plus sign**, **comma**, or a **line break**.
You can combine up to 20 elements, and element names can be up to 240 characters long!
For example, you can do **air, air, air**.
You can see the information on an element with **?<element name>** or by its ID with **?#<element ID>**
You can add an image to an element with **/image** or to a category with **/catimg**
You can add a creator mark to an element with **/mark**
You can view categories with **/cat**
Add elements to categories with **/addcat** and remove elements from categories with **/rmcat**
You can use **/lb** to view the leaderboard and **/inv** to see what elements you have
You can use **/hint** to get a hint on how to make an element.
You can use **/idea** to get a random unused combination.
You can use **/path** to get the path for an element or **/catpath** to get the path for a category.
